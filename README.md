## ‚öôÔ∏è System Design

### üîπ **Audio Frequency Analysis**
The audio sample consists of a conversation with noise, including thunder and high-frequency tones. The audio signal is first analyzed using two techniques:
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: Used to identify the frequency components of the audio signal.
- **Spectrogram**: Provides a visual representation of the signal's frequency content over time.

### üîπ **Butterworth Filter Design**
A **Butterworth lowpass filter** is used to remove high-frequency noise while maintaining the desired low-frequency signals. The filter is designed with the following specifications:
- **Filter Order**: Chosen based on the desired cut-off frequency and noise characteristics.
- **Cut-off Frequency**: Selected to isolate speech frequencies and attenuate the noise.

### üîπ **Filter Implementation**
The audio signal is processed through the Butterworth filter in MATLAB. Key steps include:

1. **Before Filtering (DFT)**: The frequency components of the noisy signal are analyzed to visualize the unwanted high-frequency noise.
2. **After Filtering (DFT)**: The filtered signal is analyzed to verify that high-frequency noise has been effectively reduced.
3. **Magnitude Response**: The frequency response of the designed Butterworth filter is plotted to illustrate its attenuation of high frequencies.
4. **Time-Domain Analysis**: The final filtered signal is plotted in the time domain to confirm the noise reduction while preserving the speech signal.

## üìä Test Results

The filter was tested on an audio sample with various types of noise, including thunder and a high-frequency tone. The results confirm that the Butterworth lowpass filter effectively reduces high-frequency noise while preserving the speech signal.

### Summary of Test Results:
- **Frequency Analysis**: DFT and Spectrogram clearly demonstrate the attenuation of high-frequency noise after filtering.
- **Time-Domain Audio**: The final filtered audio signal retains the clarity of the speech while removing unwanted noise.
- **Visual Representation**: The results are illustrated in frequency-domain plots (before and after filtering) and time-domain waveforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### üìù Usage Instructions

1. **Load the audio file (input_audio.wav) and analyze it using the `butterworth_filter.m` script:**
   - The script will load the audio file and display its initial analysis.
   - Ensure the audio file is placed in the project directory or provide the full path to the file.

2. **Design and apply the Butterworth filter to the audio signal:**
   - The script will design a **Butterworth lowpass filter** based on the specified parameters (cutoff frequency, filter order).
   - The filter will be applied to the audio file to reduce high-frequency noise.

3. **Visualize the results using DFT, Spectrogram, and Time-Domain plots:**
   - The script generates visualizations of the signal in both the **frequency domain** (before and after filtering) and the **time domain** to show the effects of the filter.
